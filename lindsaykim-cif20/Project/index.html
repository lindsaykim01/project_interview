I definitely think there’s something after death but I feel like it’s some thing that I find it easier to conceptualize within the context of a more spiritual and vague point of view since the idea of an after life is obviously a pretty big idea to grapple with but I definitely think there’s a place for our energy after we die in the universe or in some other dimension or in some other reality that we don’t really experience during our lives within our bodies.

And things seem to have affected each other in my opinion. I feel that because everyone was forced inside and was forced to slow down it created an environment where a conversation about racism in America could be taken seriously so I can see how the pandemic has some positive side effects and I would not want to take something away that has opened up a doorWhere progress can be made on such an important issue. But if I could take away this pandemic without affecting the process and attention that needs to be paid to important social and political issues I would because I am definitely not an online learner and I have been struggling to adapt to a zoom-based classroom and I would like to go to back to an in person classroom.</span><span class="v35_152"> ...</span><span class="v35_153">10</span><span class="v36_19">SPECIAL?</span><span class="v36_20">WHOME was it given by?</span><span class="v36_21">My legal name is actually Grace and that was the name that my parents picked out for me before I was born, but then apparently once they saw me they decided that I looked more like an Annie than a Grace so They decided to call me Annie and have that be my name but legally keep my first name as Grace. So I kind of have two first names and one of them is a lie but I definitely feel like I fit the name Annie more.</span><span class="v36_22">7</span><span class="v36_23">Is your NAME</span><span class="v36_24"> ...</span><span class="v36_7">I don’t really like when people talk over me and I have a hard time asserting myself in a conversation so I tend to get frustrated by that a lot but other than that I don’t really get easily bothered by much

I love the fine arts like painting and I love to illustrate but I also really enjoy using the digital component to design and I definitely have a lot to learn when it comes to the digital component of design but I’ve always been excited to learn more.

Overall I love Parsons and I know that no university or institution is perfect but I feel that the people in charge of this program take it so seriously and I’ve been really impressed with all of the professors that I’ve been working with this far. It’s definitely different than my high school experience on so many different levels so it was a big change for me to attend such a competitive and serious art school and I really appreciate how serious everyone takes the work they’re doing but I definitely think that Parsons offers me a lot in terms of my education, and while I felt that the community can often be or at least seem more competitive than other programs I definitely appreciate being pushed harder in my studies because of that environment.
